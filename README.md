## Tip calculator

# Instructions

If your bill is $150, divide it into 5 people with a 12% tip.

Each person must pay (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6

Format the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60

So everyoneâ€™s share of the total bill is $30.00 to $3.60 tips.

Tip: There are two ways to round up the numbers. You may need to google some to solve this problem. ðŸ’ª
